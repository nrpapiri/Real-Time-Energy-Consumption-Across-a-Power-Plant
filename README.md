Real-Time-Energy-Consumption-Across-a-Power-Plant
=================================================

Combining both VBA and SQL, the script runs a query to access real time energy data across a power plant facility. Database permissions are predefined in the script, and the user can select desired dates. The script will check the dates, run the query, pull the data, and then perform basic calculations in VBA for metrics such as daily energy usage, revenue, and peak loads.
